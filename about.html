        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Chiamaka Orabuchi, and I'm thrilled to be a part of AltSchool. Let me take a moment to share a bit about who I am, why I chose to pursue software engineering, and what I hope to achieve during my time at Alt School.</p>

        <h2>Personal Details</h2>
        <p>I'm from Lagos,Nigeria where my passion for technology first took root. From a young age, I've been fascinated by the way software can transform ideas into reality, making the complex simple and the impossible achievable. As a healthcare professional who pivoted into product design, I've always found joy in problem-solving and creativity, two qualities I believe align seamlessly with the world of software engineering.

            Outside of the digital realm, you might find me creating content on skincare or learning a new language. Whether it's exploring the latest tech trends, enjoying a good kdrama, or engaging in outdoor activities, I'm always seeking ways to broaden my horizons and stay inspired.</p>

            <h2>Reason for joining Altschool</h2>
            <p>The decision to join Altschool was a natural progression of my journey. Having researched various institutions, I was drawn to the school's methodof teaching and strong alumni network. The teaching method resonated with my vision of not just learning to code but understanding the intricacies of software development, from design to deployment.

            Moreover, the vibrant community at Altschool stood out to me. The opportunity to collaborate with like-minded individuals and learn from experienced professionals is something I believe will significantly enrich my learning experience.></p>

            <h2>What i plan to achieve with Altschool</h2>
